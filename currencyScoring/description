Scoring Mechanism for the Currency Set consisting of 19 currencies.

Data set from Jan 2010.
Periodicity of Rebalance : 3 Months (Quarter)

Factors Used:
1) Current Account as percentage of GDP
2) Real Interest Rate
3) Real Effective Exchange Rate

Picking Best 5 currency from score created -> Long them for the Quarter
Picking Worst 5 currency from score created -> Short them for the Quarter

Limitation and Improvement:
1) For now the current account data we have is for quarter, The rebalancing frequency can be changed to every month if monthly current account data
is available.
2) Other factors can be added ( Long term debt, Inflation rate, etc)
